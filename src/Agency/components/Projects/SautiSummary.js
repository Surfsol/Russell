            <span className="colorBlue">React</span>: When our team inherited
            the project React was already being used. We stuck with React
            because it was easy to build additional components on top of the
            existing page and for Reacts ability to conditionally Render
            components. This was especially valuable when we blocked off certain
            functionality based on the user's tier.

          <h3>
            <span className="colorBlue">Graphql</span>: We inherited the project
            with graphql already implemented. Graphql was a wise decision for
            this app due to its ability to query specific data. Whereas, on a
            REST framework we would have to deal with many endpoints and do .get
            requests on large amounts of unneeded data.

            to the screen.

            <span className="colorBlue">AG-Grid React</span>: We selected
            Ag-grid-react for its ability to display account information in a
            spreadsheet like format, which comes with a variety of built in
            filtering options so staff members can easily access and filter
            through account information. The grid receives all account
            information from the backend by making a query through
            apollo/graphql. We also added additional columns to the grid to
            allow editing and deleting functionality of selected accounts
            displayed within the grid.

            Sauti is a non-profit organization that caters to cross-boarder

            The organization has been collecting data from informal trades in
            Region of Africa known as Sauti since 2017. This data is very
            valuable to Government officials, researchers and developers for
            insight to market trends, pricing and trader demographics.

              parsed json format. Parsing is done on a cron job. Additional
              parsing enabled us to increase the database by 50%.

              E. Sauti then decided to make this a standalone app, in which most
              of the data would need to be accessed via a paywall. So we needed
              to implement tiered access to certain types of data and filtering
              tools.{" "}

              Account page, enabling customers to buy, cancel and monitor their
